# Mars Survival Index :comet:
## Hi, this is a fun project to predict your survival chances on Mars.
## About this project
Mars survival index will show you **hypothetical** survival chances you would have on Mars when particular environmental and life support resources are applied. 
I turned to NASA [Insight API](https://api.nasa.gov/) for the recorded (and available) weather conditions (temperature, wind speed, and pressure) to simulate Mars's environment. To make it more fun, I included life-support parameters that you would have to take with you to "survive on Mars" as well as Mars's environment customization card.
Your chances are counted based on those parametres and translated to hours and minutes you can survive on Mars on "that" day. 
**Important note:** math behind it is really simple, tho I did my best to follow common sense and scientific appproach, those calculations *do not indicate* actual survival chances.

### Images, arts
#### Background
I used Nasa [Mars Rover Photos API](https://api.nasa.gov/) to generate a background image for the first part of the website and Inkscape to make a background for an additional section.

I do want to make my own sprites for an astronaut and a rover, but it is still in work.

#### Design - Figma
Initially, I did some wireframes in Figma. My intentions from the beginning were to make responsive design, so sketches were everything to me. I followed mobile-first approach.

<div display="flex" gap="10">
    <img src="/public/assets/readme-img/1.png" width="auto" height="200"/>
    <img src="/public/assets/readme-img/2.png" width="auto" height="200"/>
    <img src="/public/assets/readme-img/3.png" width="auto" height="200"/>
    <img src="/public/assets/readme-img/4.png" width="auto" height="200"/>
</div>

### Future Work
My website is a one-page site; well, **for now**. At least, the idea is to iterate and add 2 more pages with space/Mars related mini-games - Space Quiz and Survival Mission (a card game).
